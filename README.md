# maken
This is my first attempt at making an issue tracker. I would like it to be super fast and as scalable as I know how to make it. I would also like to make it pretty modular with smart interfaces to work with different UIs and different DBs. I'm making this in conjunction with [nkr](https://github.com/r-neal-kelly/nkr) my new C++ 20 library.
